# PROJECT: Calculator_React
The BookStore project comes with the React-Redux section. In this project we will learn how to build a simple React/Redux application. We will work in a real-world project for a fictional company that requires help. The project has been split into multiple milestones, and each milestone has functional and technical requirements that will need to implement.
